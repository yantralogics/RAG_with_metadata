[['Linkin Park also participated in numerous charitable events, which
included raising money to benefit victims of Hurricane Charley in 2004
and later Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[10] The band donated $75,000 to
the Special Operations Warrior Foundation in March 2004.[57] They also
helped relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims by
staging several charity concerts and setting up an additional fund
called Music for Relief.[58] The band participated at Live 8, a series
of charitable benefit concerts set up to raise global awareness.[59]
Alongside Jay-Z, the band performed on Live 8\'s stage in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a global audience.[59] The band would
later be reunited with Jay-Z at the Grammy Award Ceremony 2006, during
which they performed "Numb/Encore", en route to winning a Grammy for
Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.[60][61] They were joined on stage by Paul
McCartney who added verses from the song "Yesterday".[62][63] They
would later go on to play at the 2006 Summer Sonic music festival,
which was hosted by Metallica in Japan.[64]\n'], ['Unlike with Latin
texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since
late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in
medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, mathematics,
and philosophy had been studied since the High Middle Ages in Western
Europe and in the Islamic Golden Age (normally in translation), but
Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the
Greek dramatists, Demosthenes and Thucydides) were not studied in
either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these
sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue
that the Timurid Renaissance in Samarkand and Herat, whose
magnificence toned with Florence as the center of a cultural
rebirth,[35][36] were linked to the Ottoman Empire, whose conquests
led to the migration of Greek scholars to Italian cities.[37][full
citation needed][38][full citation needed][15][39] One of the greatest
achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of
Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since
late antiquity.\n'], ['The term "postmodernity" was first used as a
general concept for a historical movement by Arnold J. Toynbee in an
1939 essay, which states that "Our own Post-Modern Age has been
inaugurated by the general war of 1914 1918".[25] Author Peter Drucker
suggests that the transformation into a postmodern world happened
between 1937 and 1957, which he describes as a "nameless era"
characterized as a shift to a conceptual world based on pattern,
purpose, and process rather than a mechanical cause. Most scholars
today agree postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late
1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.[26] This shift is
defined by four observations: the emergence of an educated society,
the importance of international development, a decline of the nation-
state, and a collapse of the viability of non-Western
cultures.[27]\n'], ['In an interview with Fuse, Shinoda confirmed that
Linkin Park had begun recording their sixth studio album in May
2013.[152] The band released the first single from their upcoming
album, titled, "Guilty All the Same" (featuring Rakim) on March 6,
2014, through Shazam.[153] The single was later released on the
following day by Warner Bros. Records and debut at No. 27 on the US
Billboard Rock Airplay charts before peaking at No. 1 on the
Mainstream Rock charts in the following weeks.[154][155] Shortly after
the single\'s release, the band revealed their sixth album would be
titled The Hunting Party.[156] The album was produced by Shinoda and
Delson, who wanted to explore musical elements from Hybrid Theory and
the band\'s earlier material.[157] Shinoda commented the album is a
"90s style of rock record". He elaborated, "It\'s a rock record. It\'s
loud and it\'s rock, but not in the sense of what you\'ve heard
before, which is more like \'90s hardcore-punk-thrash.\'[158] The
album includes musical contributions from rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton
of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian
of System of a Down.[159][160] The songs "Until It\'s Gone",[161]
"Wastelands",[160] "Rebellion" (featuring Daron Malakian),[162] and
"Final Masquerade"[163] were released as singles from the album.The
Hunting Party was released on June 13, 2014,[164] in most countries,
and later released in the United States on June 17.[165]\n'], ['In the
Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness   that which was turned
within as that which was turned without   lay dreaming or half awake
beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and
childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen
clad in strange hues.[143]'], ['Postmodernism is an intellectual
stance or mode of discourse[1][2] characterized by skepticism towards
elements of the Enlightenment worldview. It questions the "grand
narratives" of modernity, rejects the certainty of knowledge and
stable meaning, and acknowledges the influence of ideology in
maintaining political power.[3][4] The idea of objective claims is
dismissed as na ve realism,[5] emphasizing the conditional nature of
knowledge.[4] Postmodernism embraces self-referentiality,
epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony,
irreverence, and eclecticism.[4] It opposes the "universal validity"
of binary oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and
categorization.[6][7]\n'], ["Bennington and Shinoda both reported that
Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park's initial
recordings.[25][26] The label's A&R was not pleased with the band's
hip-hop and rock-style approach.[25][26] An A&R representative
suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and
exclusively focus on making a rock record.[25][26] Bennington
supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park's vision for
the album.[25][26] Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band
released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, that same
year.[12]\n"], ['The English Renaissance is different from the Italian
Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English
Renaissance were literature and music, which had a rich flowering.[92]
Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than
in the Italian Renaissance. The English Renaissance period in art
began far later than the Italian, which had moved into Mannerism by
the 1530s.[93]\n'], ['Rapid accumulation of knowledge, which has
characterized the development of science since the 17th century, had
never occurred before that time. The new kind of scientific activity
emerged only in a few countries of Western Europe, and it was
restricted to that small area for about two hundred years. (Since the
19th century, scientific knowledge has been assimilated by the rest of
the world).'], ['Episcopal priest and conservative cultural
commentator J. M. Thompson, in an 1914 article, uses the term to
describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of religion,
writing, "the raison d\' tre of Post-Modernism is to escape from the
double-mindedness of modernism by being thorough in its criticism by
extending it to religion as well as theology, to Catholic feeling as
well as to Catholic tradition."[16] In 1926, Bernard Iddings Bell,
president of St. Stephen\'s College (now Bard College), published
Postmodernism and Other Essays, which marks the first use of the term
to describe an historical period following modernity.[17][18] The
essay criticizes lingering socio-cultural norms, attitudes, and
practices of the Age of Enlightenment. It is also critical of a
purported cultural shift away from traditional Christian beliefs, for
which it suggests orthodox Christianity is the
solution.[19][20][21]\n']]
