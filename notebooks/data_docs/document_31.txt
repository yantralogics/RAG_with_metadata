2020, outbreaks occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability
to enforce adequate social distancing.[237][238] In the United States,
the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk
for poor outcomes from COVID 19 due to high rates of coexisting heart
and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality
healthcare.[237]\n'], ['Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose
COVID 19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection
but are not recommended for routine screening.[167][179] Bilateral
multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and
posterior distribution are common in early infection.[167][180]
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with
variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the
disease progresses.[167][181] Characteristic imaging features on chest
radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic
include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural
effusions.[182]\n'], ['Linkin Park reached No.9 in the Billboard

peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the Aragonese Crown
and the city of Valencia. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come
from the Crown of Aragon, including Ausi s March and Joanot Martorell.
In the Crown of Castile, the early Renaissance was heavily influenced
by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as the
Marquis of Santillana, who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain
in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique,
Fernando de Rojas, Juan del Encina, Juan Bosc n Almog ver, and
Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon.
Miguel de Cervantes's masterpiece Don Quixote is credited as the first
Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th
century, with influential writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives,
grammarian Antonio de Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mex
a.\n"], ['The University of Oxford\'s CEBM has pointed to mounting
evidence[175][176] that "a good proportion of \'new\' mild cases and
people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from
hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus
particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and
have called for "an international effort to standardize and
periodically calibrate testing"[177] In September 2020, the UK
government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in
laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results
