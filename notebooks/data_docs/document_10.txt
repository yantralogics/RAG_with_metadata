[['One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the
support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to
the olfactory neurons.[124] The involvement of both the central and
peripheral nervous system in COVID 19 has been reported in many
medical publications.[125] It is clear that many people with COVID-19
exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not
detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of
COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has
been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from
COVID 19, but these results need to be confirmed.[126] While virus has
been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism
by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve
invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the
brain.[127][128][129] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from
the lungs and cross the blood brain barrier to gain access to the CNS,
possibly within an infected white blood cell.[126]\n'], ["Linkin

Middle Ages, when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying
Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and
mathematics,[e] Renaissance scholars were most interested in
recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and
oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century
with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch,
Coluccio Salutati (1331 1406), Niccol  de' Niccoli (1364 1437), and
Poggio Bracciolini (1380 1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in
search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy, and
Seneca.[33] By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such
Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance
humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to
recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and
theological texts.[34]\n"], ['COVID 19 may also cause substantial
structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months
after hospital discharge.[146] A low level of blood lymphocytes may
result from the virus acting through ACE2-related entry into
lymphocytes.[147]\n'], ['Since the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic,
scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and
political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health
crisis.[527] Academics have pointed to the moral distress of
healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources
such as ventilators,[528] and the global justice of vaccine
diplomacies.[citation needed] The socio-economic inequalities between
genders,[529] races,[530] groups with disabilities,[531]
communities,[532] regions, countries,[533] and continents have also
drawn attention in academia and the general public.\n'], ['A cytokine
storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is
responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID
19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm
causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such
as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury,
and vasculitis. The production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and
interferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses,
inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of the
central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are
also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting
the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are
not uncommon.[162]\n'], ["Linkin Park has sold more than 100 million
records worldwide.[317][318] The group's first studio album Hybrid
Theory is one of the best-selling albums in the US (12\xa0million
copies shipped) and worldwide (30\xa0million copies sold).[319]
Billboard estimates that Linkin Park earned US$5 million between May
2011 and May 2012, making them the 40th-highest-paid musical
artist.[320] 11 of the band's singles have reached the number one
position on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, the second-most for
any artist.[321]\n"], ['In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread
rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon
to the rest of Europe. The invention of the printing press by German
printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new
ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted
to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the
Renaissance into regional and national movements.\n'], ['Linkin Park
is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the
world\'s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million
records worldwide.[5] They have won two Grammy Awards, six American
Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards,
10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003,
MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era
and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park
No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was
voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on
VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as "The Biggest Rock Band in the
World Right Now" by Kerrang!.\n'], ['Their fifth album, Living Things,
is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences,
resulting in a harder sound by comparison.[299][300] The band returned
to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on The Hunting
Party, which was described as an alternative metal,[301][302][303] nu
metal,[304] hard rock,[301][305] rap rock,[306] and rap metal
