[['An early Italian humanist who came to Poland in the mid-15th
century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland
with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I in
1518.[133] This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies
in both areas, as well as by newly established universities.[134] The
Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century
and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellonian
dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish
Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European
Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial
period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major
wars   aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and
southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the
country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions
improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched
the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained
dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish
Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.\n'], ["In
Minutes to Midnight the band experimented with their established sound
and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and
styles, a process Los Angeles Times compares to a stage in U2's
work.[284] Only two songs on the album's tracklist feature rap vocals
and the majority of the album can be considered alternative
rock.[285][286]\n"], ["The unique political structures of Italy during
the Late Middle Ages have led some to theorize that its unusual social
climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy
did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period.
Instead, it was divided into smaller city-states and territories: the
Neapolitans controlled the south, the Florentines and the Romans at
the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west
respectively, and the Venetians to the east. 15th-century Italy was
one of the most urbanized areas in Europe.[42] Many of its cities
stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that
the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in
the Roman Empire's heartland.[43]\n"], ['Common side effects of COVID
19 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the
injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and
arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment
within a few days.[211][212] COVID 19 vaccination is safe for people
who are pregnant or are breastfeeding.[213]\n'], ["The Black Death
caused greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure
than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among
members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to
function during this period. Formal meetings of elected
representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due
to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials
was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured
continuity of government.[53]\n"], ['A cytokine storm is due to an
acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical
illness in an array of diseases but in COVID 19, it is related to
worse prognosis and increased fatality. The storm causes acute
respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes,
myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and
vasculitis. The production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and
interferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses,
inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. The cells of the
central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are
also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting
the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are
not uncommon.[162]\n'], ['While very young children have experienced
lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that
is similar to the population as a whole.[319][320] Children are likely
to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than
adults.[321] The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of
hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU,[322] while a European
multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found
that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive
care.[323] Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died,
but the actual mortality rate may be "substantially lower" since
milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the
study.[324][325]\n'], ['Linkin Park began working on new material for
a seventh studio album in November 2015.[187] Chester Bennington
commented on the album\'s direction by stating, "We\'ve got a lot of
great material that I hope challenges our fanbase as well as inspires
them as much as it has us."[188] In February 2017, Linkin Park
released promotional videos on their social network accounts, which
featured Shinoda and Bennington preparing new material for the
album.[189] Mike Shinoda stated the band was following a new process
when producing the album. Brad Delson elaborated: "We\'ve made so many
records and we clearly know how to make a record and we definitely
didn\'t take the easy way out this time."[190]\n'], ['The Elizabethan
era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the
height of the English Renaissance. Many scholars see its beginnings in
the early 16th century during the reign of Henry VIII.[91]\n'], ["In
stark contrast to the High Middle Ages, when Latin scholars focused
almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science,
philosophy and mathematics,[e] Renaissance scholars were most
interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary,
historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the
14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as
Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331 1406), Niccol  de' Niccoli (1364
1437), and Poggio Bracciolini (1380 1459) scoured the libraries of
Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius,
Livy, and Seneca.[33] By the early 15th century, the bulk of the
surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of
Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars
turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical
and theological texts.[34]\n"]]
