Balassi (poet), Sebesty n Tin di Lantos (poet), B lint Bakfark
(composer and lutenist), and Master MS (fresco painter).\n'], ['Italy
had its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from
China.[451] Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths
on 19 March 2020.[452] By 26 March the United States had overtaken
China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the
world.[453] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of
COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than
directly from China or any other Asian country.[454] Retesting of
prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27
December 2019,[455][456] and a person in the United States who died
from the disease on 6\xa0February 2020.[457]\n'], ['One common
symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of
the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory
neurons.[124] The involvement of both the central and peripheral
nervous system in COVID 19 has been reported in many medical
publications.[125] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit
neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the
central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with
neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low
levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID 19, but these
results need to be confirmed.[126] While virus has been detected in
cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it
invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of
peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the
brain.[127][128][129] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from
the lungs and cross the blood brain barrier to gain access to the CNS,
possibly within an infected white blood cell.[126]\n'], ['In July
2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a
new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new
album did not come out in 2012.[123][124] He later revealed in another
interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning
phases of the next album, saying "We just kind of began. We like to
keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the
time\xa0... we like the direction that we\'re going in".[125] On March
28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for
"Burn It Down",[126] directed by Joe Hahn.[127] Shinoda spoke to
Co.Create about the album\'s art, saying that it will "blow them [the
fans] away\xa0... the average person is not going to be able to look
at it and go, I understand that that\'s completely new, like not just
the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there\'s
going to be that".[128]\n'], ['According to scientific reviews smokers
are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-
smokers.[299][300] Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors
affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the
disease.[300] Short-term[301] and chronic[302] exposure to air
pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID
19.[303][304][305] Pre-existing heart and lung diseases[306] and also
obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease,
contributes to an increased health risk of COVID
19.[300][307][308][309]\n'], ['Neurologic manifestations include
seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain Barr  syndrome (which
includes loss of motor functions).[71][72] Following the infection,
children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome,
which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be
fatal.[73][74] In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and
it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID 19
and have an altered mental status.[75]\n'], ['Chest CT scans may be
helpful to diagnose COVID 19 in individuals with a high clinical
suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine
screening.[167][179] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with
a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in
early infection.[167][180] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular
septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation
may appear as the disease progresses.[167][181] Characteristic imaging
features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people
who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass
opacities without pleural effusions.[182]\n'], ['The severity of the
inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the
cytokine storm.[160] Levels of interleukin\xa01B, interferon-gamma,
interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant
protein\xa01 were all associated with COVID 19 disease severity.
Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains
to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID 19
disease.[161]\n'], ['In the Netherlands, a particularly vibrant
artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van
Eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in
Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas,
and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. Later, the
work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict
themes of everyday life.[66]\n'], ['The humanists believed that it is
important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body,
which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to
create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical
excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually
any situation.[62] This ideology was referred to as the uomo
universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the
Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as
it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an
intensive understanding of human behavior.\n']]
