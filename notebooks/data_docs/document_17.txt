[['COVID 19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in
most countries. However, in a few countries like India, Nepal,
Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than
men.[343] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and
more likely to die.[367][368] One meta-analysis found that globally,
men were more likely to get COVID 19 than women; there were
approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43
56.58).[369]\n'], ['Preventive measures to reduce the chances of
infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask
in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others,
ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[190]
washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty
seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching
the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[191][192]\n'], ["The
plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the
ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the
population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people
to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the
year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of
the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom.
To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of
the most favorable position economically.[50]\n"], ['Other important

characters, and a new song called "Blackbirds" which was unlockable by

track on A Thousand Suns.[96]\n'], ["It has long been a matter of
debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not elsewhere in
Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine
cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have
emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later
ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo
de' Medici (1449 1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts
patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the
leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro
Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti.[14] Works by Neri di Bicci,
Botticelli, Leonardo, and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned
additionally by the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto in
Florence.[54]\n"], ['The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces
leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability,
alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung
surfactants. These effects cause the majority of the respiratory
symptoms. However, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a
cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response
syndrome.[157]\n'], ['The new Italian trend combined with existing
national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art.
Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival
of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at
Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so
a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of
Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this
process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among
them Vit z J nos, archbishop of Esztergom, one of the founders of
Hungarian humanism.[102] During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of
Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic
palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458 1490)
rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded
it.[103][104]\n'], ['In the Netherlands, a particularly vibrant
artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van
Eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in
Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas,
and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. Later, the
work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict
themes of everyday life.[66]\n']]
