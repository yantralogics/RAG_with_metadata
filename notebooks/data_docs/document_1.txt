[['Common side effects of COVID 19 vaccines include soreness, redness,
rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia
(muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without
medical treatment within a few days.[211][212] COVID 19 vaccination is
safe for people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding.[213]\n'],
['Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID 19 will
experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[293][294] A majority
of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report
long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[295] On
30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a
significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious
long-term effects". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID 19
symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning". They range
from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and
injury of major organs\xa0  including the lungs and heart, and also
neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can
affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical
bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood
swings, and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy
of achieving herd immunity by infection, rather than vaccination, is
"morally unconscionable and unfeasible".[296]\n'], ['Structuralism is
a philosophical movement that was developed by French academics in the
1950s, partly in response to French existentialism, and often
interpreted in relation to modernism and high modernism. Thinkers
include anthropologist Claude L vi-Strauss, linguist Ferdinand de
Saussure, Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, semiotician Algirdas
Greimas, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, and literary theorist Roland
Barthes.[57]\n'], ['In an interview with Fuse, Shinoda confirmed that
Linkin Park had begun recording their sixth studio album in May
2013.[152] The band released the first single from their upcoming
album, titled, "Guilty All the Same" (featuring Rakim) on March 6,
2014, through Shazam.[153] The single was later released on the
following day by Warner Bros. Records and debut at No. 27 on the US
Billboard Rock Airplay charts before peaking at No. 1 on the
Mainstream Rock charts in the following weeks.[154][155] Shortly after
the single\'s release, the band revealed their sixth album would be
titled The Hunting Party.[156] The album was produced by Shinoda and
Delson, who wanted to explore musical elements from Hybrid Theory and
the band\'s earlier material.[157] Shinoda commented the album is a
"90s style of rock record". He elaborated, "It\'s a rock record. It\'s
loud and it\'s rock, but not in the sense of what you\'ve heard
before, which is more like \'90s hardcore-punk-thrash.\'[158] The
album includes musical contributions from rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton
of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian
of System of a Down.[159][160] The songs "Until It\'s Gone",[161]
"Wastelands",[160] "Rebellion" (featuring Daron Malakian),[162] and
"Final Masquerade"[163] were released as singles from the album.The
Hunting Party was released on June 13, 2014,[164] in most countries,
and later released in the United States on June 17.[165]\n'], ['Linkin
Park embarked on a large world tour titled "Minutes to Midnight World
Tour". The band promoted the album\'s release by forming their fourth
Projekt Revolution tour in the United States which included many
musical acts like My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, HIM,
Placebo, and many others.[78] They also played numerous shows in
Europe, Asia, and Australia which included a performance at Live Earth
Japan on July 7, 2007.[79] and headlining Download Festival in
Donington Park, England[80] and Edgefest in Downsview Park, Toronto,
Ontario, Canada.[81] The band completed touring on their fourth
Projekt Revolution tour before taking up an Arena tour around the
United Kingdom, visiting Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester,[82]
before finishing on a double night at the O2 arena in London.[83]
Bennington stated that Linkin Park plans to release a follow-up album
to Minutes to Midnight.[84] However, he stated the band will first
embark on a United States tour to gather inspiration for the
album.[84] Linkin Park embarked on another Projekt Revolution tour in
2008.[85] The United States Projekt Revolution tour featured Chris
Cornell, the Bravery, Ashes Divide, Street Drum Corps and many
others.[85] Mike Shinoda announced a live CD/DVD titled Road to
Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes, which is a live video recording
from the Projekt Revolution gig at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 29,
2008, which was officially released on November 24, 2008.[86]\n'],
["Modernism sought to design and plan cities that followed the logic
of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-
scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation, and prefabricated design
solutions.[64] Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to
recognise differences and aim towards homogeneous landscapes (Simonsen
1990, 57). Jane Jacobs' 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American
Cities[65] was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had
developed within modernism and marked a transition from modernity to
postmodernity in thinking about urban planning.[66]\n"], ['COVID-19 is
mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by
droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus.
Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough,
sneeze, or sing.[80][81][82][83] Transmission is more likely the
closer people are. However, infection can occur over longer distances,
particularly indoors.[80][84]\n'], ['In July 2011, Bennington told
Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every
eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not
come out in 2012.[123][124] He later revealed in another interview in
September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the
next album, saying "We just kind of began. We like to keep the
creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the
time\xa0... we like the direction that we\'re going in".[125] On March
28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for
"Burn It Down",[126] directed by Joe Hahn.[127] Shinoda spoke to
Co.Create about the album\'s art, saying that it will "blow them [the
fans] away\xa0... the average person is not going to be able to look
at it and go, I understand that that\'s completely new, like not just
the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there\'s
going to be that".[128]\n'], ['Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most
of the research into COVID 19 treatments.[492][493] Other candidates
