[['In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from
Spain seeking a direct route to India of the Delhi Sultanate. He
accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached
the East Indies.\n'], ['Living Things was released on June 26 in the
United States.[129][130][131][132] The album sold over 223,000 copies

Linkin Park\'s single "Castle of Glass" was nominated for \'Best Song
in a Game\' at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.[142] The band also
performed at the award ceremony on December 7, but lost the award to
"Cities" by Beck.[142] Linkin Park also played at the Soundwave music
festival in Australia, where they shared the stage with Metallica,
Paramore, Blink-182, and Sum 41.[143][144]\n'], ['The intense
international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist
scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, Andr  de Resende, and Dami o
de G is, a friend of Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the
reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and Andr  de Gouveia made relevant
teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the
Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas
More[138] and Albrecht D rer to the wider world.[139] There, profits
and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age,
especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured Jewish community
expelled from Portugal.\n'], ['Criticisms of postmodernism are
intellectually diverse. Since postmodernism criticizes both
conservative and modernist values as well as universalist concepts
such as objective reality, morality, truth, reason, and social
progress, critics of postmodernism often defend such concepts from
various angles.\n'], ['Jean-Fran ois Lyotard is credited with being
the first to use the term "postmodern" in a philosophical context, in
his 1979 work The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. In it,
he follows Wittgenstein\'s language games model and speech act theory,
contrasting two different language games, that of the expert, and that
of the philosopher. He talks about the transformation of knowledge
into information in the computer age and likens the transmission or
reception of coded messages (information) to a position within a
language game.[3]\n'], ["The plague was carried by fleas on sailing
vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to
lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2
million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's
population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the
decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased,
and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need
for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position
economically.[50]\n"], ['Historian and political philosopher Quentin
Skinner points out that Otto of Freising (c. 1114 1158), a German
bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a
widespread new form of political and social organization, observing
that Italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society
was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-
monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance
fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad Government by Ambrogio
Lorenzetti (painted 1338 1340), whose strong message is about the
virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration.
Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were
devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many
defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406 1475)
celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and
architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and
political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same
time".[44]\n'], ['Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke,
encephalitis, and Guillain Barr  syndrome (which includes loss of
motor functions).[71][72] Following the infection, children may
develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has
symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[73][74] In
very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be
considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID 19 and have an
altered mental status.[75]\n'], ['On April 26, the band released an
app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, a game called 8-Bit
Rebellion! It featured the band as playable characters, and a new song
