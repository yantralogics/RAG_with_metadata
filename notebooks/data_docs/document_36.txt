[['On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan
inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing "I have every
intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a
lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it\'ll take
time."[222] On March 29, however, Shinoda stated that he was uncertain
of Linkin Park\'s future when being interviewed by Vulture.[223] On
April 17, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018
Billboard Music Awards, but did not win any of them.[224] The band was
presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical
Achievement at UCLA on May 18.[225] On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said
in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though
what form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated "I know the
other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and
so to not do that would be like, I don\'t know, almost like
unhealthy." When asked about the band\'s future minus Bennington,
Shinoda stated, "It\'s not my goal to look for a new singer. If it
does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a
great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some
stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing
Chester."[226]\n'], ['Rapid accumulation of knowledge, which has
characterized the development of science since the 17th century, had
never occurred before that time. The new kind of scientific activity
emerged only in a few countries of Western Europe, and it was
restricted to that small area for about two hundred years. (Since the
19th century, scientific knowledge has been assimilated by the rest of
the world).'], ["The new ideals of humanism, although more secular in
some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, especially in
the Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was
commissioned by or in dedication to the Church.[25] However, the
Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary theology,
particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man
and God.[25] Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers
of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Huldrych Zwingli, Thomas
More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.\n"], ["The Black Death caused
greater upheaval to Florence's social and political structure than
later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members
of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to
function during this period. Formal meetings of elected
representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due
to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials
was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured
continuity of government.[53]\n"], ['In the Netherlands, a
particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van
der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential on the
development of painting in Italy, both technically with the
introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of
naturalism in representation. Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the
Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday
life.[66]\n'], ['In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
initiated the Solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some
promising drugs: an experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial
drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two anti-HIV drugs,
lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta.[494][495] More than 300
active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.[70]\n'], ["The
Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean
possessions of the Aragonese Crown and the city of Valencia. Many
early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Crown of Aragon,
including Ausi s March and Joanot Martorell. In the Crown of Castile,
the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism,
starting with writers and poets such as the Marquis of Santillana, who
introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century.
Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del
Encina, Juan Bosc n Almog ver, and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close
resemblance to the Italian canon. Miguel de Cervantes's masterpiece
Don Quixote is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance
humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential
writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives, grammarian Antonio de
Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mex a.\n"], ["Modernism sought
to design and plan cities that followed the logic of the new model of
industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions,
aesthetic standardisation, and prefabricated design solutions.[64]
Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences
and aim towards homogeneous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Jane
Jacobs' 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities[65] was
a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within
modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in
thinking about urban planning.[66]\n"], [' Research conducted when
Alpha was the dominant variant has suggested COVID-19 may cause brain
damage.[130] Later research showed that all variants studied
(including Omicron) killed brain cells, but the exact cells killed
varied by variant.[131] It is unknown if such damage is temporary or
permanent.[132][133] Observed individuals infected with COVID-19 (most
with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue
lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared
with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was
equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing;
infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. All
effects were more pronounced among older ages.[134]\n']]
