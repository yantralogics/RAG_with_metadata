[['The case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided
by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based
on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio
is 1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023.[344] The number
varies by region.[345][346]\n'], ['In 1949, the term was used to
describe a dissatisfaction with the modernist architectural movement
known as the International Style.[23] Postmodernism in architecture
was initially marked by a re-emergence of surface ornament, reference
to surrounding buildings in urban settings, historical reference in
decorative forms (eclecticism), and non-orthogonal angles.[24]\n'],
['Historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner points out that
Otto of Freising (c. 1114 1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy
during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political
and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited
from feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and
commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in
the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad
Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338 1340), whose strong
message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and
good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city
republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that
there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406
1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and
architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and
political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same
time".[44]\n'], ['Most scientists believe the virus spilled into human
populations through natural zoonosis, similar to the SARS-CoV-1 and
MERS-CoV outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human
history.[408][409] According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change several social and environmental factors including climate
change, natural ecosystem destruction and wildlife trade increased the
likelihood of such zoonotic spillover.[410][411] One study made with
the support of the European Union found climate change increased the
likelihood of the pandemic by influencing distribution of bat
species.[412][413]\n'], ['The Renaissance\'s intellectual basis was
its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas
and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of
Protagoras, who said that "man is the measure of all things". Early
examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the
revived knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of
metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th
century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across
Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th
century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of
Giotto.\n'], ['Some pets, especially cats and ferrets, can catch this
virus from infected humans.[472][473] Symptoms in cats include
respiratory (such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.[472] Cats can
spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to
humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been
proven.[472][474] Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this
infection.[474] Behaviours which increase the risk of transmission
include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.[474]\n'], ["By the
15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well
aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using
phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et
alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe
their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as
antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new).[85] From
Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his
own time) was an age of national eclipse.[85]\nLeonardo Bruni was the
first to use tripartite periodization in his History of the Florentine
People (1442).[86] Bruni's first two periods were based on those of
Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy
was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar
framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman
Empire (1439 1453).\n"], ['As is common with infections, there is a
delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the
appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is
four to five days[52] possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those
days.[53] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to
seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one
symptom within 12 days.[52][54]\n'], ['A key metric in gauging the
severity of COVID 19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also
referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality
risk.[349][350][351] This metric is calculated by dividing the total
number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected
individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates
asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported
cases.[352]\n']]
