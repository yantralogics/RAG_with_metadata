[['The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the
death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.[370] Later reviews in
June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in
susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[371][372] One review
acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting
that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and
drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[373] Smoking, which in
some countries like China is mainly a male activity, is a habit that
contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among
men.[343] Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of
smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as
hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the
higher mortality in men.[374] In Europe as of February 2020, 57% of
the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID 19 were
men.[375] As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-
related data of COVID 19 infections.[376] Research has shown that
viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and
women differently.[376]\n'], ['Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to
international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory
(2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu
metal scene, the album\'s singles\' heavy airplay on MTV led the
singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling", and "In the End" all to chart
highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed
over to the #2 spot on the nation\'s Billboard Hot 100.[1] Their
second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band\'s success.[2] The
band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to
Midnight (2007).[3] By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among
the most successful and popular rock acts.[4]\n'], ['After spending a
considerable time searching for Wakefield\'s replacement, Xero
recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by
Jeff Blue in March 1999.[12][13] Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge
band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the
dynamic in his singing style.[6] The band then agreed on changing
their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry
between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them
to work on new material.[6][14] Additionally, the band recruited
bassist Kyle Christner to temporarily fill in for Farrell.[15] In May
1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they
circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an
online "street team".[16] In October 1999, Christner was replaced by
Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass
tracks for the band\'s recordings.[15][17]\n'], ['Additionally, people
with COVID 19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have
classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive
protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and
ferritin.[152]\n'], ['A suitable environment had developed to question
classical scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World
by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works
of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found to not
always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and Counter-
Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift
in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the
biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).[73] The
willingness to question previously held truths and search for new
answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.\n'],
['As of December\xa02021[update], there are five dominant variants of
SARS-CoV-2 spreading among global populations: the Alpha variant
(B.1.1.7, formerly called the UK variant), first found in London and
Kent, the Beta variant (B.1.351, formerly called the South Africa
variant), the Gamma variant (P.1, formerly called the Brazil variant),
the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, formerly called the India variant),[114]
and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries
as of 7 December.[115][116]\n'], ['Although Italian Renaissance had a
modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in
broadening the European worldview,[135] stimulating humanist inquiry.
Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and
Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As
the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in
the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several
breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology,
including Pedro Nunes, Jo o de Castro, Abraham Zacuto, and Martin
Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Est v o Gomes, and
Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary
Tom  Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Crist v o da Costa
collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated
by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.\n'], ['Some early studies
suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID 19 will experience symptoms
lasting longer than a month.[293][294] A majority of those who were
admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems
including fatigue and shortness of breath.[295] On 30 October 2020,
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that "to a significant number of
people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects".
He has described the vast spectrum of COVID 19 symptoms that fluctuate
over time as "really concerning". They range from fatigue, a cough and
shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs\xa0
including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic
effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body.
Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches,
months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros
therefore concluded that a strategy of achieving herd immunity by
infection, rather than vaccination, is "morally unconscionable and
unfeasible".[296]\n'], ["Culture in the Netherlands at the end of the
15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade
via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned
artists who became known across Europe.[125] In science, the anatomist
Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map
assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish
Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus
Bosch[126] to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the
Elder.[125]\n"], ['Their fifth album, Living Things, is also an
electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a
harder sound by comparison.[299][300] The band returned to a heavier
sound compared to their last three albums on The Hunting Party, which
was described as an alternative metal,[301][302][303] nu metal,[304]
hard rock,[301][305] rap rock,[306] and rap metal album.[307] Their
seventh album, One More Light, was described as pop,[308][309] pop
rock[271][310] and electropop.[311]\n']]
