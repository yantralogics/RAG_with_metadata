Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-
states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government,
Christianity and the birth of capitalism.[28] This analysis argues
that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were
absolute monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the
independent city-republics of Italy took over the principles of
capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast
unprecedented Commercial Revolution that preceded and financed the
Renaissance.[citation needed]\n'], ['The first confirmed human
infections were in Wuhan. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed
COVID 19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the
earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1\xa0December
2019.[425][426][427] Official publications from the WHO reported the
earliest onset of symptoms as 8\xa0December 2019.[428] Human-to-human
transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20
January 2020.[429][430] According to official Chinese sources, these
were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also
sold live animals.[431] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the
CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested
negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an
early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the
initial outbreak.[432] Traces of the virus have been found in
wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on
18 December 2019.[433]\n'], ['Some pets, especially cats and ferrets,
can catch this virus from infected humans.[472][473] Symptoms in cats
include respiratory (such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.[472]
Cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the
virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not
been proven.[472][474] Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to
this infection.[474] Behaviours which increase the risk of
transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the
animal.[474]\n'], ['Historian and political philosopher Quentin
Skinner points out that Otto of Freising (c. 1114 1158), a German
bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a
widespread new form of political and social organization, observing
that Italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society
was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-
monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance
fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad Government by Ambrogio
Lorenzetti (painted 1338 1340), whose strong message is about the
virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration.
Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were
devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many
defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406 1475)
celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and
architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and
political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same
time".[44]\n'], ['The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed
from those of the Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists
were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the
purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance
artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the
contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht D rer. Later,
the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of
daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also
during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan
van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists
to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for
centuries.[131] A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of
the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater
freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the
decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular
languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a
major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin.[132] The spread
of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern
Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of
printing.\n'], ['Other important figures of Hungarian Renaissance
include B lint Balassi (poet), Sebesty n Tin di Lantos (poet), B lint
Bakfark (composer and lutenist), and Master MS (fresco painter).\n'],
['In 2020, outbreaks occurred in prisons due to crowding and an
inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[237][238] In the
United States, the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are
at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID 19 due to high rates of
coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality
healthcare.[237]\n'], ["The unique political structures of Italy
during the Late Middle Ages have led some to theorize that its unusual
social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence.
Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period.
Instead, it was divided into smaller city-states and territories: the
Neapolitans controlled the south, the Florentines and the Romans at
the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west
respectively, and the Venetians to the east. 15th-century Italy was
one of the most urbanized areas in Europe.[42] Many of its cities
stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that
the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in
the Roman Empire's heartland.[43]\n"], ['Around 10% to 30% of non-
hospitalised people with COVID-19 go on to develop long COVID. For
those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence of long-term effects
is over 50%.[15] Long COVID is an often severe multisystem disease
with a large set of symptoms. There are likely various, possibly
coinciding, causes.[15] Organ damage from the acute infection can
explain a part of the symptoms, but long COVID is also observed in
people where organ damage seems to be absent.[326]\n']]
