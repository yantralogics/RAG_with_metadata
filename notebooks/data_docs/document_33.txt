[['As a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative
flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the
14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which
contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear
perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality
in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. In
politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the
customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased
reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the
Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific
pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field
of accounting,[5] it is perhaps best known for its artistic
developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da
Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance
man".[6][7]\n'], ['The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are
grouped into either clades or lineages.[105][106] The WHO, in
collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities,
institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems
for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID,
Nextstrain and Pango. The expert group convened by the WHO recommended
the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for
example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that
they "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific
audiences".[107] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades
(19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven
(L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[108] The Pango tool groups variants into
lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1
lineage.[106][109]\n'], ['Renaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at
the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the
distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of
highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267 1337) is
credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it
was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi
(1377 1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404
1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic
technique.[63]\n'], ['The Renaissance was certainly underway before
Lorenzo de\' Medici came to power   indeed, before the Medici family
itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society. Some historians have
postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a
result of luck, i.e., because "Great Men" were born there by
chance:[55] Leonardo, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in
Tuscany. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians
have contended that these "Great Men" were only able to rise to
prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the
time.[56]\n'], ['The CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces
reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection.[226] When indoors, increasing
the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing
the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.[226][227] The WHO
recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help
clear out infectious aerosols.[228][229][230]\n'], ['The art historian
Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of
"Renaissance":\n'], ['Rapid accumulation of knowledge, which has
characterized the development of science since the 17th century, had
never occurred before that time. The new kind of scientific activity
emerged only in a few countries of Western Europe, and it was
restricted to that small area for about two hundred years. (Since the
19th century, scientific knowledge has been assimilated by the rest of
the world).'], ['The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning
surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce
risk of transmission.[250][251] The CDC recommends that if a COVID 19
case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day
care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared
electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote
controls, and ATMs used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[252]
Surfaces may be decontaminated with 62 71 per cent ethanol, 50 100 per
cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent
hydrogen peroxide, 0.2 7.5 per cent povidone-iodine, or 50 200 ppm
hypochlorous acid. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and
chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. Ultraviolet germicidal
irradiation may also be used,[228] although popular devices require 5
10\xa0min exposure and may deteriorate some materials over time.[253]

the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of
surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inoculum volumes) can be seen

vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2\xa0December 2020 by the
UK medicines regulator MHRA.[195] It was evaluated for emergency use
authorisation (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other
countries.[196] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health
guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID 19,
before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting
of a clinical trial.[197][70] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic
measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID 19 is
trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening
the curve".[198] This is done by slowing the infection rate to
decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for
better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until
effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[198][199]\n'],
['RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy
have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and
December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies
have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are
often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to
contamination or if only one gene target is detected.[458] A September
2020 review journal article said, "The possibility that the COVID 19
infection had already spread to Europe at the end of last year is now
indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence",
including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in France and Italy in
November and December.[459]\n']]
