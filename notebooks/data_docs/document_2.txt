[['Linkin Park began working on new material for a seventh studio
album in November 2015.[187] Chester Bennington commented on the
album\'s direction by stating, "We\'ve got a lot of great material
that I hope challenges our fanbase as well as inspires them as much as
it has us."[188] In February 2017, Linkin Park released promotional
videos on their social network accounts, which featured Shinoda and
Bennington preparing new material for the album.[189] Mike Shinoda
stated the band was following a new process when producing the album.
Brad Delson elaborated: "We\'ve made so many records and we clearly
know how to make a record and we definitely didn\'t take the easy way
out this time."[190]\n'], ['Unlike with Latin texts, which had been
preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the
study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western
Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, mathematics, and philosophy
had been studied since the High Middle Ages in Western Europe and in
the Islamic Golden Age (normally in translation), but Greek literary,
oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists,
Demosthenes and Thucydides) were not studied in either the Latin or
medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were
only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue that the Timurid
Renaissance in Samarkand and Herat, whose magnificence toned with
Florence as the center of a cultural rebirth,[35][36] were linked to
the Ottoman Empire, whose conquests led to the migration of Greek
scholars to Italian cities.[37][full citation needed][38][full

Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural
works back into Western Europe for the first time since late
antiquity.\n'], ['In an interview with Fuse, Shinoda confirmed that
Linkin Park had begun recording their sixth studio album in May
2013.[152] The band released the first single from their upcoming
album, titled, "Guilty All the Same" (featuring Rakim) on March 6,
2014, through Shazam.[153] The single was later released on the
following day by Warner Bros. Records and debut at No. 27 on the US
Billboard Rock Airplay charts before peaking at No. 1 on the
Mainstream Rock charts in the following weeks.[154][155] Shortly after
the single\'s release, the band revealed their sixth album would be
titled The Hunting Party.[156] The album was produced by Shinoda and
Delson, who wanted to explore musical elements from Hybrid Theory and
the band\'s earlier material.[157] Shinoda commented the album is a
"90s style of rock record". He elaborated, "It\'s a rock record. It\'s
loud and it\'s rock, but not in the sense of what you\'ve heard
before, which is more like \'90s hardcore-punk-thrash.\'[158] The
album includes musical contributions from rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton
of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian
of System of a Down.[159][160] The songs "Until It\'s Gone",[161]
"Wastelands",[160] "Rebellion" (featuring Daron Malakian),[162] and
"Final Masquerade"[163] were released as singles from the album.The
Hunting Party was released on June 13, 2014,[164] in most countries,
and later released in the United States on June 17.[165]\n'], ['In
November 2017, the band announced that a live album compiled from
their final tour with Bennington, titled One More Light Live, would be
released on December 15.[216][217] On November 19, Linkin Park
received an American Music Award for Favorite Alternative Artist and
dedicated the award to Bennington.[218][219]\n'], ["Erasmus was
arguably the Netherlands' best known humanist and Catholic
intellectual during the Renaissance.[32]\n"], ["Linkin Park is an
American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's lineup
consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead
guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn,
and drummer Rob Bourdon, with vocalist Chester Bennington also part of
the band until his death in 2017. Categorized as alternative rock,
Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip
hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop
elements.\n"], ['Autopsies of people who died of COVID 19 have found

was granted regulatory approval on 2\xa0December 2020 by the UK
medicines regulator MHRA.[195] It was evaluated for emergency use
authorisation (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other
countries.[196] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health
guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID 19,
before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting
of a clinical trial.[197][70] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic
measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID 19 is
trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening
the curve".[198] This is done by slowing the infection rate to
decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for
better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until
effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[198][199]\n'],
['The intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and
architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-
architect Charles Jencks, beginning with lectures in the early 1970s
and his essay "The Rise of Post Modern Architecture" from 1975.[38]
His magnum opus, however, is the book The Language of Post-Modern
Architecture, first published in 1977, and since running to seven
editions.[39] Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like
Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it
is not just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms double coding:
"Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something
else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to
communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other
architects."[40] In their book, "Revisiting Postmodernism", Terry
Farrell and Adam Furman argue that postmodernism brought a more joyous
and sensual experience to the culture, particularly in
architecture.[41]\n'], ['Some observers have questioned whether the
Renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the Middle Ages, instead
seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical
antiquity,[19] while social and economic historians, especially of the
longue dur e, have instead focused on the continuity between the two
eras,[20] which are linked, as Panofsky observed, "by a thousand
ties".[21][d]\n']]
