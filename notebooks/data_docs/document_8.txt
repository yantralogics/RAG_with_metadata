[["Like structuralists, post-structuralists start from the assumption
that people's identities, values, and economic conditions determine
each other rather than having intrinsic properties that can be
understood in isolation.[58] Structuralists explore how the subjects
of their study might be described as a set of essential relationships,
schematics, or mathematical symbols. Post-structuralism, by contrast,
is characterized by new ways of thinking through structuralism,
contrary to the original form.[59]\n"], ['In the late-20th century,
avant-garde academics labelled American singer Madonna, as the
"personification of the postmodern",[52] with Christian writer Graham
Cray saying that "Madonna is perhaps the most visible example of what
is called post-modernism",[53] and Martin Amis described her as
"perhaps the most postmodern personage on the planet".[53] She was
also suggested by assistant professor Olivier S cardin of Utrecht
University to epitomise postmodernism.[54]\n'], ['It is also assumed
that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting
severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.[310] One research study that looked
into the COVID 19 infections in hospitalised kidney transplant
recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.[311]\n'], ['The transmission
of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or
droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are
expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are three types of
transmission:  droplet  and  contact , which are associated with large
droplets, and  airborne , which is associated with small droplets.[85]
If the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster
than they evaporate, and therefore they contaminate surfaces
surrounding them.[85] Droplets that are below a certain critical size,
evaporate faster than they settle; due to that fact, they form nuclei
that remain airborne for a long period of time over extensive
distances.[85]\n'], ['The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of
cells and systems of the body. COVID 19 is most known for affecting
the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower
respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[119] The lungs are the organs
most affected by COVID 19 because the virus accesses host cells via
the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the
lungs.[120] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a
"spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host
cell.[121]\n'], ["After Italy, Hungary was the first European country
where the Renaissance appeared.[100] The Renaissance style came
directly from Italy during the Quattrocento (1400s) to Hungary first
in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early
Hungarian-Italian relationships   not only in dynastic connections,
but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations\xa0  growing
in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian
and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason\xa0  exaggerated
breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light
structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term
work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New)
Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegr d, Tata, and V rpalota. In
Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant
of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and
Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.[101]\n"], ['On April 26, the band
released an app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, a game called
8-Bit Rebellion! It featured the band as playable characters, and a
new song called "Blackbirds" which was unlockable by beating the game.
The song was also later released as an iTunes bonus track on A
Thousand Suns.[96]\n'], ['The virus also affects gastrointestinal
organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of
gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[135] as well as endothelial
cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[136]\n'], ['Many groups
have created COVID 19 datasets that include imagery such as the
Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international
online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[183] Due to
overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without
confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID
19.[182] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and
demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection,
it is faster and more sensitive.[166]\n'], ['The movement to
reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical,
oratorical, and theological texts back into the Western European
curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio
Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar Manuel Chrysoloras (c.
1355 1415) to teach Greek in Florence.[41] This legacy was continued
by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from Basilios Bessarion to
Leo Allatius.\n']]
