In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new).[85] From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.[85]\\nLeonardo Bruni was the first to use tripartite periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442).[86] Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline.
