[['Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis,
and Guillain Barr  syndrome (which includes loss of motor
functions).[71][72] Following the infection, children may develop
paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms
similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[73][74] In very rare
cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in
those who have been diagnosed with COVID 19 and have an altered mental
status.[75]\n'], ['Emerging in the mid-twentieth century as a reaction
against modernism,[8][9][10] postmodernism has permeated various
disciplines[11] and is linked to critical theory, deconstruction, and
post-structuralism.[4]\n'], ['The new Italian trend combined with
existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance
art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous
arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians
studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine
humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The
growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to
Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist
prelates, among them Vit z J nos, archbishop of Esztergom, one of the
founders of Hungarian humanism.[102] During the long reign of emperor
Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the
largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus
(r. 1458 1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and
further expanded it.[103][104]\n'], ['By 1650, Dutch cartographers had
mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named New
Holland, except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by James
Cook.\n'], ['During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and
disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan
coronavirus",[22][23][24] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan
pneumonia".[25][26] In the past, many diseases have been named after
geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[27] Middle East
respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus.[28] In January 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV[29] and 2019-nCoV
acute respiratory disease[30] as interim names for the virus and
disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using
geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names
to prevent social stigma.[31][32][33] The official names COVID 19 and
SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19
being shorthand for "coronavirus disease 2019".[34][35] The WHO
additionally uses "the COVID 19 virus" and "the virus responsible for
COVID 19" in public communications.[34][36]\n'], ['The Renaissance has
a long and complex historiography, and in line with general skepticism
of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among
historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the
"Renaissance" and individual cultural heroes as "Renaissance men",
questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a
historical delineation.[18]\n'], ["The Renaissance began in Florence,
one of the many states of Italy.[13] Various theories have been
proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a
variety of factors, including Florence's social and civic
peculiarities at the time: its political structure, the patronage of
its dominant family, the Medici,[14] and the migration of Greek
scholars and their texts to Italy following the fall of Constantinople
to the Ottoman Turks.[15][16][17] Other major centers were Venice,
Genoa, Milan, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, and Naples. From
Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe and also to American,
African and Asian territories ruled by the European colonial powers of
the time or where Christian missionaries were active. \n"], ['The band
still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for
additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major
record labels.[12] After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on
three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner
Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a
developing artist in 1999.[18][19] However, the label advised the band
to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid.[20][21] The band
considered the names "Plear" and "Platinum Lotus Foundation" before
deciding on "Linkin Park",[22] a play on and homage to Santa Monica\'s
Lincoln Park,[6] now called Christine Emerson Reed Park.[23] They
initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed
it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain
"linkinpark.com".[21][24]\n'], ['In April 2012, the band announced
that Living Things would be the title of their fifth album and called
it a "return to form".[129][130] Shinoda stated that they chose the
title Living Things because the album is more about people, personal
interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous
albums.[131] The album\'s lead single, "Burn It Down", was released on
April 16.[126] The band promoted the album on the 2012 edition of the
Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus.[132][133][134] Other
singles from the album include "Lost in the Echo",[135]
"Powerless",[136] and Castle of Glass".[137] The band performed "Burn
It Down" at 2012 Billboard Music Awards.[138][139] On May 25, the band
released the music video for "Burn It Down"[132] and debuted "Lies
Greed Misery", another song from Living Things.[140] "Powerless", the
twelfth and closing track of the album, was featured in the closing
credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.[136]\n']]
