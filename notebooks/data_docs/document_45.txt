['Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial
cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID 19 have
symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings
of elevated IL 2, IL 7, IL 6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM CSF), interferon gamma-induced protein\xa010
(IP 10), monocyte chemoattractant protein\xa01 (MCP1), macrophage
inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP 1 alpha), and tumour necrosis factor
(TNF ) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an
underlying immunopathology.[139]\n'], ['The first confirmed human
infections were in Wuhan. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed
COVID 19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the
earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1\xa0December
2019.[425][426][427] Official publications from the WHO reported the
earliest onset of symptoms as 8\xa0December 2019.[428] Human-to-human
transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20
January 2020.[429][430] According to official Chinese sources, these
were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also
sold live animals.[431] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the
CDC, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested
negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an
early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the
initial outbreak.[432] Traces of the virus have been found in
wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on
18 December 2019.[433]\n'], ['After spending a considerable time
searching for Wakefield\'s replacement, Xero recruited Arizona
vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue in March
1999.[12][13] Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze,
became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his
singing style.[6] The band then agreed on changing their name from
Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and
Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new
material.[6][14] Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle
Christner to temporarily fill in for Farrell.[15] In May 1999, the
band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated
across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online
"street team".[16] In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott
Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks
for the band\'s recordings.[15][17]\n'], ["The new ideals of humanism,
although more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian
backdrop, especially in the Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most,
of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church.[25]
However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary
theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship
between man and God.[25] Many of the period's foremost theologians
were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Huldrych
Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.\n"], ["Many of
the group's song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion and
personal struggle and suffering.[316]\n"], ['In late 2019, the WHO
assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or
epidemiologically diagnosed COVID 19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection.[184]\n'], ['The English Renaissance is different from the
Italian Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the
English Renaissance were literature and music, which had a rich
flowering.[92] Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less
significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English Renaissance
period in art began far later than the Italian, which had moved into
Mannerism by the 1530s.[93]\n'], ['A Thousand Suns was released on
September 14.[90][97] The album\'s first single, "The Catalyst", was

launching a concert tour, which started on October 2010.[100] Other
singles from the album include, "Waiting for the End",[101][102]
"Burning in the Skies",[103] and "Iridescent".[104] Furthermore, a
documentary about the album\'s production, titled Meeting of A
Thousand Suns, was available.[105] On August 31, 2010, it was
announced that the band would perform "The Catalyst" live for the
first time at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12,
2010.[106] The venue of the debut live performance of the single was
