'Since the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic, scholars have explored
the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of
healthcare policies related to the public health crisis. Academics
have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of
distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, and the
global justice of vaccine diplomacies.citation needed The socio-
economic inequalities between genders, races, groups with
disabilities, communities, regions, countries, and continents have
also drawn attention in academia and the general public.\n',
'Additionally, people with COVID 19 and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
D-dimer, and ferritin.\n', 'The University of Oxford\'s CEBM has
pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of \'new\' mild
cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge
from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless
virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with"
and have called for "an international effort to standardize and
periodically calibrate testing" In September 2020, the UK government
issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to
provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of
low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of
positive test results".\n', "It has long been a matter of debate why
the Renaissance began in Florence, and not elsewhere in Italy.
Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural
life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have
emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later
ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo
de' Medici (1449 1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts
patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the
leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro
Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci,
Botticelli, Leonardo, and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned
additionally by the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto in Florence.\n",
"Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's
National Health Commission after a small study was completed. It is
undergoing a Phase\xa0II non-randomised trial at the national level in
Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm
(also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine
release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are
thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. The
interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist was approved by the FDA to
undergo a Phase\xa0III clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on
COVID 19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of
steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different
cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017. There is no randomised, controlled
evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS.
Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels
by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood brain barrier,
and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence
of CRS.\n", 'Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection
include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public,
avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating
indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands
with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising
good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or
mouth with unwashed hands.\n', "Culture in the Netherlands at the end
of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through
trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned
artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist
Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map
assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish
Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch
to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the Elder.\n",
'Criticism of postmodernist movements in the arts include objections
to departure from beauty, the reliance on language for the art to have
meaning, a lack of coherence or comprehensibility, deviation from
clear structure, and consistent use of dark and negative themes.\n',
'In April 2012, the band announced that Living Things would be the
title of their fifth album and called it a "return to form". Shinoda
stated that they chose the title Living Things because the album is
more about people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal
than their previous albums. The album\'s lead single, "Burn It Down",
was released on April 16. The band promoted the album on the 2012
edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. Other
singles from the album include "Lost in the Echo", "Powerless", and
Castle of Glass". The band performed "Burn It Down" at 2012 Billboard
Music Awards. On May 25, the band released the music video for "Burn
It Down" and debuted "Lies Greed Misery", another song from Living
Things. "Powerless", the twelfth and closing track of the album, was
featured in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire
Hunter.\n', 'On August 20, 2020, their 20th anniversary, Linkin Park
collaborated with virtual reality rhythm game Beat Saber to release 11
maps based on their songs.\n'
