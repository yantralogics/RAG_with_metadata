[['A suitable environment had developed to question classical
scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by
Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of
Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found to not
always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and Counter-
Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift
in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the
biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).[73] The
willingness to question previously held truths and search for new
answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.\n'],

France, imported by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A
factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the
Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported
Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate
palaces at great expense. Writers such as Fran ois Rabelais, Pierre de
Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as
Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the
spirit of the Renaissance.\n'], ['Emerging in the mid-twentieth
century as a reaction against modernism,[8][9][10] postmodernism has
permeated various disciplines[11] and is linked to critical theory,
deconstruction, and post-structuralism.[4]\n'], ['There are many
unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that
they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with

Beatrice of Naples, Buda became one of the most important artistic
centers of the Renaissance north of the Alps.[105] The most important
humanists living in Matthias' court were Antonio Bonfini and the
famous Hungarian poet Janus Pannonius.[105] Andr s Hess set up a
printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus's library, the
Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collections of secular
books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the
15th century. His library was second only in size to the Vatican
Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and
religious materials.)[106] In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence
wrote that Lorenzo de' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library
encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus's library is
part of UNESCO World Heritage.[107]\n"], ['Some historians have begun
to consider the word Renaissance to be unnecessarily loaded, implying
an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive
"Dark Ages", the Middle Ages. Most political and economic historians
now prefer to use the term "early modern" for this period (and a
considerable period afterwards), a designation intended to highlight
the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the
modern era.[149] Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider
the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of
western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as
a period of great innovation.[150]\n'], ["The new ideals of humanism,
although more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian
backdrop, especially in the Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most,
of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church.[25]
However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary
theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship
between man and God.[25] Many of the period's foremost theologians
were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Huldrych
Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.\n"], ['As a
cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of
Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century
resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which
contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear
perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality
in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. In
politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the
customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased
reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the
Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific
pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field
of accounting,[5] it is perhaps best known for its artistic
developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da
Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term "Renaissance
man".[6][7]\n'], ['In addition to the above, other clinical studies
have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in
different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its
impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection
may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of
the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be foetal growth
restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to
the foetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as
the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of
life.[163] For preterm birth, a 2023 review indicates that there
appears to be a correlation with COVID-19.[164]\n']]
