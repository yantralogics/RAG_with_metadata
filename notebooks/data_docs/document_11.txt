ended on May 5, 2023. By this time, everyday life in most countries
had returned to how it was before the pandemic.[461][462]\n'], ['Other
important figures of Hungarian Renaissance include B lint Balassi
(poet), Sebesty n Tin di Lantos (poet), B lint Bakfark (composer and

suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally harboured by bats,
and spread to humans multiple times from infected wild animals at the
Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in December 2019.[408][409] A minority
of scientists and some members of the U.S intelligence community
believe the virus may have been unintentionally leaked from a
laboratory such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology.[414][415] The US
intelligence community has mixed views on the issue,[416][417] but
overall agrees with the scientific consensus that the virus was not
developed as a biological weapon and is unlikely to have been
genetically engineered.[418][419][420][421] There is no evidence SARS-
CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the
pandemic.[422][423][424]\n'], ['Science and art were intermingled in
the early Renaissance, with polymath artists such as Leonardo da Vinci
making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Leonardo set up
controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and
systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised
principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him
as the "father of modern science".[g] Other examples of Da Vinci\'s
contribution during this period include machines designed to saw
marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany,
geology, anatomy, and mechanics.[72]\n'], ['Other periods of cultural
rebirth have also been termed "renaissances", such as the Bengal
Renaissance, Tamil Renaissance, Nepal Bhasa renaissance, al-Nahda or
the Harlem Renaissance. The term can also be used in cinema. In
animation, the Disney Renaissance is a period that spanned the years
from 1989 to 1999 which saw the studio return to the level of quality
not witnessed since their Golden Age of Animation. The San Francisco
Renaissance was a vibrant period of exploratory poetry and fiction
writing in that city in the mid-20th century.\n'], ['Johan Huizinga
(1872 1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but
questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Autumn of
the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of
decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was
important.[19] The Medieval Latin language, for instance, had evolved
greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used
in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical
purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its
classical form. This view is however somewhat contested by recent
studies. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep
economic recession.[146] Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike
have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original
than has traditionally been supposed.[147] Finally, Joan Kelly argued
that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the
agency women had had during the Middle Ages.[148]\n'], ['Displacement
ventilation with large natural inlets can move stale air directly to
the exhaust in laminar flow while significantly reducing the
concentration of droplets and particles. Passive ventilation reduces
energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lack controllability
and heat recovery. Displacement ventilation can also be achieved
mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. The use of
large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed
environments. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because
recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes
possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and
range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the
air.[231]\n'], ['COVID 19 transmission occurs when infectious
particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or
mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but
small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in
the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors.
Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or
mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated
by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can
spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.[17]\n'], ["In
architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was foremost in studying the
remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge
from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline
of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that
emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of
engineering was building the dome of the Florence Cathedral.[67]
Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew
in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the
High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining
the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and
Maderno.\n"], ['On April 28, 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the
band is working on new music.[227] On August 13, the band released
"She Couldn\'t", a track that was originally recorded in 1999, and it
was included on a 20th anniversary edition of their debut album Hybrid
Theory, released on October 9.[228] On January 8, 2021, Linkin Park
released a remix of "One Step Closer" by American electronic duo 100
gecs. The band revealed it was the first of many new remixes inspired
by Reanimation to come.[229] On October 29, when asked about the band
playing live shows again, Shinoda stated that "Now is not the time
[for the band\'s return]. We don\'t have the focus on it. We don\'t
have the math worked out. And I don\'t mean that by financially math,
I mean that like emotional and creative math."[230] In April 2022,
Shinoda reiterated that the band was not working on a new album, new
music, or touring.[231][232]\n']]
