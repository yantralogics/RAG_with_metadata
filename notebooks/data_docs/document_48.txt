[["It has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in
Florence, and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several
features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such
a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the
Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing
and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449 1492) was the
catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his
countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence,
including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo
Buonarroti.[14] Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, Leonardo, and
Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the Convent of
San Donato in Scopeto in Florence.[54]\n"], ['The rediscovery of
ancient texts and the invention of the printing press in about 1440
democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely
distributed ideas. In the first period of the Italian Renaissance,
humanists favored the study of humanities over natural philosophy or
applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further
enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe.
Writing around 1450, Nicholas Cusanus anticipated the heliocentric
worldview of Copernicus, but in a philosophical fashion.\n'], ['On
November 9, 2014, MTV Europe named Linkin Park the "Best Rock" act of
2014 at their annual music awards ceremony.[178] The band won the
\'Best Rock Band\' and \'Best Live Act\' titles of 2014 on Loudwire\'s
Music Awards.[179] Revolver ranked The Hunting Party as the fourth
best album of 2014.[180] In an interview with AltWire on May 4,
Shinoda reflected on The Hunting Party and commented on Linkin Park\'s
future, stating; "I\'m really happy with the reaction from The Hunting
Party, and I think we\'re ready to move somewhere new on the next
album, which will be coming [in 2016]".[181]\n'], ['In April 2012, the
band announced that Living Things would be the title of their fifth
album and called it a "return to form".[129][130] Shinoda stated that
they chose the title Living Things because the album is more about
people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal than their
previous albums.[131] The album\'s lead single, "Burn It Down", was
released on April 16.[126] The band promoted the album on the 2012
edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners
Incubus.[132][133][134] Other singles from the album include "Lost in
the Echo",[135] "Powerless",[136] and Castle of Glass".[137] The band
performed "Burn It Down" at 2012 Billboard Music Awards.[138][139] On
May 25, the band released the music video for "Burn It Down"[132] and
debuted "Lies Greed Misery", another song from Living Things.[140]
"Powerless", the twelfth and closing track of the album, was featured
in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire
Hunter.[136]\n'], ['Social distancing (also known as physical
distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the
spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of
schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home,
limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings,
and physically distancing themselves from others.[236]\n'], ['The
symptoms of COVID-19 are variable depending on the type of variant
contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal
illness.[37][38] Common symptoms include coughing, fever, loss of
smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia), with less common ones including
headaches, nasal congestion and runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat,
diarrhea, eye irritation,[39] and toes swelling or turning purple,[40]
and in moderate to severe cases, breathing difficulties.[41] People
with the COVID-19 infection may have different symptoms, and their
symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have
been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum,
shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with
muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of
digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[41] In
people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste
combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19 and is
reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.[42][43][44]\n'],
['Men with untreated hypogonadism were 2.4 times more likely than men
with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted COVID-19;
Hypogonad men treated with testosterone were less likely to be
hospitalised for COVID-19 than men who were not treated for
hypogonadism.[312]\n'], ['A high incidence of thrombosis and venous
thromboembolism occurs in people transferred to intensive care units
with COVID 19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[142]
Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high
D-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in
mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and
ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications
leading to death in people infected with COVID 19.[143] Infection may
initiate a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body,
including pulmonary vasoconstriction   a possible mechanism in which
oxygenation decreases during pneumonia.[143] Furthermore, damage of
arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people
who died from COVID 19.[144][145]\n'], ['Jorge Luis Borges\' (1939)
short story "Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote", is often
considered as predicting postmodernism[44] and is a paragon of the
ultimate parody.[45] Samuel Beckett is also considered an important
precursor and influence. Novelists who are commonly connected with
postmodern literature include Vladimir Nabokov, William Gaddis,
Umberto Eco, Italo Calvino, Pier Vittorio Tondelli, John Hawkes,
William S. Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut, John Barth, Robert Coover, Jean
Rhys, Donald Barthelme, E. L. Doctorow, Richard Kalich, Jerzy Kosi
ski, Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon[46] (Pynchon\'s work has also been
described as high modern[47]), Ishmael Reed, Kathy Acker, Ana Lydia
Vega, J chym Topol and Paul Auster.\n'], ['COVID 19 case fatality
rates are higher among men than women in most countries. However, in a
few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality
cases are higher in women than men.[343] Globally, men are more likely
to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die.[367][368] One meta-
analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID 19
than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100
infections (CI: 51.43 56.58).[369]\n']]
