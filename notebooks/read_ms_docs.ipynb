      "Paragraphs: ['Summary', 'Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band\\'s lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, and drummer Rob Bourdon, with vocalist Chester Bennington also part of the band until his death in 2017. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park\\'s earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.\\nFormed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album\\'s singles\\' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\", and \"In the End\" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the #2 spot on the nation\\'s Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band\\'s success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band\\'s fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on an indefinite hiatus following the suicide of longtime lead vocalist Bennington in July 2017 and have not recorded or toured since then. Since Bennington\\'s death, they have only released 20th-anniversary editions of their first two studio albums, as well as a greatest hits album, Papercuts, in 2024.\\nLinkin Park is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world\\'s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as \"The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by Kerrang!.\\n\\nHistory\\n1996–2000: early years\\nLinkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda\\'s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in November 1997. Xero performed their first show on November 14, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood. Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college. Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998, but believed the band needed a different vocalist. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band\\'s vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.\\nAfter spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield\\'s replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle Christner to temporarily fill in for Farrell. In May 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online \"street team\". In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks for the band\\'s recordings.\\nThe band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid. The band considered the names \"Plear\" and \"Platinum Lotus Foundation\" before deciding on \"Linkin Park\", a play on and homage to Santa Monica\\'s Lincoln Park, now called Christine Emerson Reed Park. They initially wanted to use the name \"Lincoln Park\", however they changed it to \"Linkin\" to acquire the internet domain \"linkinpark.com\".\\nBennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park\\'s initial recordings. The label\\'s A&R was not pleased with the band\\'s hip-hop and rock-style approach. An A&R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park\\'s vision for the album. Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, that same year.\\n\\n2000–2002: Hybrid Theory and Reanimation\\nLinkin Park released Hybrid Theory on October 24, 2000. The album, which represented half a decade\\'s worth of the band\\'s work, was edited by Don Gilmore. Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001. Singles such as \"Crawling\" and \"One Step Closer\" established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio play lists during the year, and \"In the End\" peaked at #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, the band\\'s highest to date. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as Dracula 2000, Little Nicky, and Valentine. Hybrid Theory won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song \"Crawling\" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video and Best Direction awards for \"In the End\".\\nDuring this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band worked with Jessica Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, \"Linkin Park Underground\", in November 2001. Linkin Park also formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a year\\'s stretch, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, Frat Party at the Pankake Festival, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed Reanimation, which would include works from Hybrid Theory and non-album tracks. Reanimation debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others. Reanimation claimed the second spot on the Billboard 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week. Hybrid Theory is also in the RIAA\\'s Top 100 Albums.\\n\\n2002–2004: Meteora\\nFollowing the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst their saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus\\'s studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. Meteora features a mixture of the band\\'s nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park\\'s second album debuted on March 25, 2003, and instantly earned worldwide recognition, peaking at No. 1 on the Rock & Metal Albums Chart.\\nMeteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the Billboard charts at the time.

More specifically, the band has been categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, and industrial rock. Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.\\nBoth Hybrid Theory and Meteora combine the alternative metal, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, and alternative rock sound with influences and elements from hip hop, and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as \"a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style,\" whereas Rolling Stone described their song \"Breaking the Habit\" as \"risky, beautiful art\".\\nIn Minutes to Midnight the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process Los Angeles Times compares to a stage in U2\\'s work. Only two songs on the album\\'s tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered alternative rock.\\nThe vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda plays as a major part within Linkin Park\\'s music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist.

Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: \"Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively\". One of the record\\'s political elements is its samples of speeches by American political figures. A Thousand Suns was described as trip hop, electronic rock, ambient, alternative rock, industrial rock, experimental rock, rap rock, and progressive rock.\\nTheir fifth album, Living Things, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison. The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on The Hunting Party, which was described as an alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, rap rock, and rap metal album. Their seventh album, One More Light, was described as pop, pop rock and electropop.\\nLinkin Park\\'s influences include Limp Bizkit, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane\\'s Addiction, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, and the Beatles.\\nMany of the group\\'s song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion and personal struggle and suffering.\\n\\nLegacy\\nLinkin Park has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.

      "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[36]\n",

While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) \"backported security updates\".[55]\n",

Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.\n",

      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[66] and metaobjects).[67] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[68][69] and logic programming.[70]\n",

      "Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[71] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[72] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[73]\n",
      "\n",
      "Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[74]\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Python features regularly violate these principles and received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat.[75][76] Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.[77] The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.[78][79]\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.\" philosophy.[74] In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.[80] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[81]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[82] Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.[83]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[84]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used \"foo\" and \"bar\".[85][86] A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. \"Pythonic\" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.[87][88]\n",

      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[89]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[90] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[91] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[92]\n",

      "The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[95][96] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[97] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[98]\n",

      "Python's expressions include:\n",

      "\n",
      "Statements cannot be a part of an expression—so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ...} is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code, but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby).[107] Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion.[108]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): old-style and new-style,[109] current Python versions only support the semantics new style.\n",

      "Python supports optional type annotations.[4][110] These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors.[111][112] Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.[113]\n",

      "Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[119]\n",

      "Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2.[120] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.[121]\n",

      "Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[122] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.[123]\n",

       "  'content': 'Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda\\'s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in November 1997. Xero performed their first show on November 14, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood. Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college. Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998, but believed the band needed a different vocalist. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band\\'s vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects.

Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle Christner to temporarily fill in for Farrell. In May 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online \"street team\". In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks for the band\\'s recordings.'},\n",

After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid. The band considered the names \"Plear\" and \"Platinum Lotus Foundation\" before deciding on \"Linkin Park\", a play on and homage to Santa Monica\\'s Lincoln Park, now called Christine Emerson Reed Park. They initially wanted to use the name \"Lincoln Park\", however they changed it to \"Linkin\" to acquire the internet domain \"linkinpark.com\".\\nBennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park\\'s initial recordings. The label\\'s A&R was not pleased with the band\\'s hip-hop and rock-style approach. An A&R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park\\'s vision for the album. Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, that same year.\\n\\n2000–2002: Hybrid Theory and Reanimation\\nLinkin Park released Hybrid Theory on October 24, 2000. The album, which represented half a decade\\'s worth of the band\\'s work, was edited by Don Gilmore. Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001. Singles such as \"Crawling\" and \"One Step Closer\" established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio play lists during the year, and \"In the End\" peaked at #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, the band\\'s highest to date. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as Dracula 2000, Little Nicky, and Valentine. Hybrid Theory won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song \"Crawling\" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video and Best Direction awards for \"In the End\".\\nDuring this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band worked with Jessica Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, \"Linkin Park Underground\", in November 2001. Linkin Park also formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a year\\'s stretch, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, Frat Party at the Pankake Festival, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed Reanimation, which would include works from Hybrid Theory and non-album tracks. Reanimation debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others.

If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody.

The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists during the show included the Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and the Filharmonic.\\n\\nMusical style and influences\\nLinkin Park combines elements of metal, industrial, punk, pop, electronic, hip hop. More specifically, the band has been categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, and industrial rock. Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.\\nBoth Hybrid Theory and Meteora combine the alternative metal, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, and alternative rock sound with influences and elements from hip hop, and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as \"a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style,\" whereas Rolling Stone described their song \"Breaking the Habit\" as \"risky, beautiful art\".\\nIn Minutes to Midnight the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process Los Angeles Times compares to a stage in U2\\'s work. Only two songs on the album\\'s tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered alternative rock.\\nThe vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda plays as a major part within Linkin Park\\'s music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park\\'s third album, Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda sings lead vocals on \"In Between\", \"Hands Held High\", and on the B-side \"No Roads Left\". On numerous songs from band\\'s fourth album, A Thousand Suns, such as the album\\'s singles (\"The Catalyst\", \"Burning in the Skies\", \"Iridescent\"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band\\'s musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica. James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead\\'s Kid A, while Jordy Kasko of Review, Rinse, Repeat likened the album to both Kid A and Pink Floyd\\'s landmark album The Dark Side of the Moon. Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: \"Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively\". One of the record\\'s political elements is its samples of speeches by American political figures. A Thousand Suns was described as trip hop, electronic rock, ambient, alternative rock, industrial rock, experimental rock, rap rock, and progressive rock.\\nTheir fifth album, Living Things, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison. The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on The Hunting Party, which was described as an alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, rap rock, and rap metal album. Their seventh album, One More Light, was described as pop, pop rock and electropop.\\nLinkin Park\\'s influences include Limp Bizkit, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane\\'s Addiction, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, and the Beatles.\\nMany of the group\\'s song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion and personal struggle and suffering.\\n\\nLegacy\\nLinkin Park has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. The group\\'s first studio album Hybrid Theory is one of the best-selling albums in the US (12 million copies shipped) and worldwide (30 million copies sold).

Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. The band was recently voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!. In 2015, Kerrang! gave \"In the End\" and \"Final Masquerade\" the top two positions on Kerrang!\\'s Rock 100 list.\\nLinkin Park became the first rock band to achieve more than one billion YouTube views. Linkin Park\\'s \"Numb\" is the third and \"In the End\" is the sixth \"timeless song\" on Spotify. The two songs make Linkin Park the only artist to have two timeless songs in the top ten.\\nHybrid Theory by the group was listed in the 2005 edition of the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, It was also ranked at #11 on Billboard\\'s Hot 200 Albums of the Decade.
