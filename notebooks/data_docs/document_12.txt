[['The word "Renaissance" is borrowed from the French language, where
it means "re-birth". It was first used in the eighteenth century and
was later popularized by French historian Jules Michelet (1798 1874)
in his 1855 work, Histoire de France (History of France).[97][98]\n'],
['The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID 19
is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent
serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people
who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to
this virus, which is then administered to active patients.[523] This
strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.[523] An updated
Cochrane review in May 2023 found high certainty evidence that, for
the treatment of people with moderate to severe COVID 19, convalescent
plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom
improvement.[524] There continues to be uncertainty about the safety
of convalescent plasma administration to people with COVID 19 and
differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in
determining efficacy.[524]\n'], ["After Italy, Hungary was the first
European country where the Renaissance appeared.[100] The Renaissance
style came directly from Italy during the Quattrocento (1400s) to
Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the
development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships   not only in
dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial
relations\xa0  growing in strength from the 14th century. The
relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second
reason\xa0  exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring
clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided
ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of
the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegr d, Tata, and V
rpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a
descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto
Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.[101]\n"], ['Several
laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which
detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.
Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for
use in the UK.[174]\n'], ['Criticism of postmodernist movements in the
arts include objections to departure from beauty, the reliance on
language for the art to have meaning, a lack of coherence or
comprehensibility, deviation from clear structure, and consistent use
of dark and negative themes.[87][88]\n'], ['They argued for
architecture that represented the spirit of the age as depicted in
cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners, or even
supposedly artless grain silos.[36]\nModernist Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe is associated with the phrase "less is more".\n'], ['Italy had
its first confirmed cases on 31 January 2020, two tourists from
China.[451] Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths
on 19 March 2020.[452] By 26 March the United States had overtaken
China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the
world.[453] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of
COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than
directly from China or any other Asian country.[454] Retesting of
prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27
December 2019,[455][456] and a person in the United States who died
from the disease on 6\xa0February 2020.[457]\n'], ['As is common with
infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes
infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay
for COVID-19 is four to five days[52] possibly being infectious on 1-4
of those days.[53] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within
two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at
least one symptom within 12 days.[52][54]\n'], ['Following Meteora\'s
success, the band worked on many side projects.[54] Bennington
appeared on DJ Lethal\'s "State of the Art" and other work with Dead
by Sunrise, while Shinoda did work with Depeche Mode, creating the
remix song "Enjoy the Silence 04".[10] In 2004, the band began to work
with Jay-Z to produce another remix album, titled Collision Course.
The album, which featured intermixed lyrics and background tracks from
both artists\' previous albums, debuted in November 2004. Shinoda also
formed Fort Minor as a side project. With the aid of Jay-Z, Fort Minor
released their debut album, The Rising Tied, to critical
acclaim.[55][56]\n'], ['Humanist scholars shaped the intellectual
landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers
such as Niccol  Machiavelli and Thomas More revived the ideas of Greek
and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary
government, following the Islamic steps of Ibn Khaldun.[60][61] Pico
della Mirandola wrote the "manifesto" of the Renaissance, the Oration
on the Dignity of Man, a vibrant defence of thinking.[citation needed]
Matteo Palmieri (1406 1475), another humanist, is most known for his
work Della vita civile ("On Civic Life"; printed 1528), which
advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the Tuscan
vernacular to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman
philosophers and theorists, especially Cicero, who, like Palmieri,
lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a
theorist and philosopher and also Quintilian. Perhaps the most
succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic
work La citt  di vita, but an earlier work, Della vita civile, is more
wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house
in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430,
Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues
include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how
citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can
ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the
difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which
is honest.[citation needed]\n']]
