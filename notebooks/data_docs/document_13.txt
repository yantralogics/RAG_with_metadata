[['The COVID 19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in
reducing the spread of COVID 19 and reducing the severity and death
caused by COVID 19.[203][206] According to a June 2022 study, COVID 19
vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185
countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December
2021.[207][208] Many countries implemented phased distribution plans
that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the
elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as
healthcare workers.[209][210]\n'], ['Emerging in the mid-twentieth
century as a reaction against modernism,[8][9][10] postmodernism has
permeated various disciplines[11] and is linked to critical theory,
deconstruction, and post-structuralism.[4]\n'], ['In June, initial
results from the randomised RECOVERY Trial in the United Kingdom
showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people
who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those
receiving supplemental oxygen.[500] Because this is a well-tested and
widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in
the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone
and other steroids.[501][502] Based on those preliminary results,
dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients
with COVID 19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require
supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID 19 who do not
require supplemental oxygen.[503]\n'], ["Linkin Park performed at the
closing ceremony of BlizzCon 2015, Blizzard's video game
convention.[185][186]\n"], ['In some ways, Renaissance humanism was
not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval
scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between
authors, Renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in the
original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and
empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of
Studia Humanitatis, the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar,
history, moral philosophy, and rhetoric. Although historians have
sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on
"a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover,
interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and
values of ancient Greece and Rome".[57] Above all, humanists asserted
"the genius of man\xa0... the unique and extraordinary ability of the
human mind".[58]\n'], ['Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these,
supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to
relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids,
rest, and nasal breathing.[263][264][265][266] Good personal hygiene
and a healthy diet are also recommended.[267] As of April 2020 the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that
those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at
home and wear a face mask.[268] As of November 2020 use of the
glucocorticoid dexamethasone had been strongly recommended in those
severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels, to reduce the
risk of death.[269][270][271] Noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately,
admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be
required to support breathing.[262] Extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address  respiratory failure, but
its benefits are still under consideration.[272][273] Some of the
cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-
inflammation, the so-called cytokine storm.[274]\n'], ['The intense
international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist
scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, Andr  de Resende, and Dami o
de G is, a friend of Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the
reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and Andr  de Gouveia made relevant
teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the
Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas
More[138] and Albrecht D rer to the wider world.[139] There, profits
and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age,
especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured Jewish community
expelled from Portugal.\n'], ['Bennington died on July 20, 2017; his
death was ruled a suicide by hanging.[200] Shinoda confirmed
Bennington\'s death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but
it\'s true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have
one".[201] The band had released a music video for their single
"Talking to Myself" earlier that day.[202] One day after Bennington\'s
death, the band canceled the North American leg of their One More
Light World Tour.[203] On the morning of July 24, Linkin Park released
an official statement on their website as a tribute to
Bennington.[204][205] On July 28, Shinoda announced that donations
made to the band\'s Music for Relief charity would be redirected to
the One More Light Fund, which had been set up in Bennington\'s
memory.[206] On August 4, when the band was initially scheduled to
play on Good Morning America, Chris Cornell\'s twelve-year-old
daughter Toni appeared with OneRepublic to perform "Hallelujah" as a
tribute to Bennington (who was the godfather to her younger brother,
Christopher) and her father.[207][208] Bennington had previously
performed the song at the funeral for Cornell, who had also died from
a suicide by hanging two months earlier.[207]\n']]
