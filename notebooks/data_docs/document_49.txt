[['The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems
of the body. COVID 19 is most known for affecting the upper
respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower
respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[119] The lungs are the organs
most affected by COVID 19 because the virus accesses host cells via
the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the
lungs.[120] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a
"spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host
cell.[121]\n'], ['Italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 January
2020, two tourists from China.[451] Italy overtook China as the
country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020.[452] By 26 March the
United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of
confirmed cases in the world.[453] Research on coronavirus genomes
indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from
European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other
Asian country.[454] Retesting of prior samples found a person in
France who had the virus on 27 December 2019,[455][456] and a person
in the United States who died from the disease on 6\xa0February
2020.[457]\n'], ['It is unknown whether different persons use similar
antibody genes in response to COVID 19.[159]\n'], ['Some criticism
responds to postmodernist skepticism towards objective reality and
claims that truth and morality are relative, including the argument
that this relativism is self-contradictory. In part in reference to
postmodernism, conservative English philosopher Roger Scruton wrote,
"A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is
\'merely relative,\' is asking you not to believe him. So don\'t."[81]
In 2014, the philosophers Theodore Schick and Lewis Vaughn wrote: "the
statement that \'No unrestricted universal generalizations are true\'
is itself an unrestricted universal generalization. So if relativism
in any of its forms is true, it\'s false."[82] Some responses to
postmodernist relativism argue that, contrary to its proponents\'
usual intentions, it does not necessarily benefit the political
left.[82][83] For example, the historian Richard J. Evans argued that
if relativism rejects truth, it can legitimize far-right pseudohistory
such as Holocaust denial.[83]\n'], ['COVID 19 transmission occurs when
infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the
eyes, nose, or mouth. The risk is highest when people are in close
proximity, but small airborne particles containing the virus can
remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances,
particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch
their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have
been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20
days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop
symptoms.[17]\n'], ['COVID 19 case fatality rates are higher among men
than women in most countries. However, in a few countries like India,
Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women
than men.[343] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU
and more likely to die.[367][368] One meta-analysis found that
globally, men were more likely to get COVID 19 than women; there were
approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43
56.58).[369]\n'], ['Displacement ventilation with large natural inlets
can move stale air directly to the exhaust in laminar flow while
significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles.
Passive ventilation reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs
but may lack controllability and heat recovery. Displacement
ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and
maintenance costs. The use of large ducts and openings helps to
prevent mixing in closed environments. Recirculation and mixing should
be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful
particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing
increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and
keeps larger particles in the air.[231]\n'], ['During the Renaissance,
extending from 1450 to 1650,[81] every continent was visited and
mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known
as Antarctica. This development is depicted in the large world map
Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula made by the Dutch cartographer Joan
Blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of Westphalia.\n'], ['COVID 19
can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed
using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or
other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.[21][166] Along with
laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID 19
in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.[167]
Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests,
which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the
infection.[21]\n'], ['Biological factors (immune response) and the
general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of
COVID 19.[343] Most of those who die of COVID 19 have pre-existing
(underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes
mellitus,[378] and cardiovascular disease.[388] According to March
data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting
conditions.[389] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanit  reported
that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1%
of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having
3.4 diseases.[288] According to this report the most common
comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type\xa02 diabetes
(29.8% of deaths), ischaemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial
fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of
deaths).\n']]
