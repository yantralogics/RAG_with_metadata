[['By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely
driven by human-to-human transmission.[370][434] The number of
COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20
December,[435] and at least 266 by 31 December.[436] On 24 December,
Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)
sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision
Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan
Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test,
showing a new coronavirus.[437] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause
was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in
Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27
December.[438] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan
Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous
positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central
Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities
of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice
to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of
unknown cause" that same evening.[439] Eight of these doctors,
including Li Wenliang (punished on 3\xa0January),[440] were later
admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another, Ai
Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[441]\n'],
['The virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs, ducks, or
chickens at all.[472] Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected
at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.[474]\n'],
['The movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary,
historical, oratorical, and theological texts back into the Western
European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from
Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar Manuel
Chrysoloras (c. 1355 1415) to teach Greek in Florence.[41] This legacy
was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from Basilios
Bessarion to Leo Allatius.\n'], ['A previously unreleased song from
the One More Light sessions, "Friendly Fire", was released on February
23, 2024.[237][238] This will be followed up by the band\'s first
greatest hits album, Papercuts, to release on April 12, which spans
their best-selling singles released between 2000 and 2023, and also
includes "Friendly Fire", as well as the official release of the song
"QWERTY", which first appeared on LP Underground 6.0 in
2006.[239]\n'], ['Both Hybrid Theory and Meteora combine the
alternative metal,[275] nu metal,[276] rap rock,[277] rap metal,[278]
and alternative rock[279] sound with influences and elements from hip
hop, and electronica,[280][281] utilizing programming and
synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as "a Johnny-
come-lately to an already overdone musical style,"[282] whereas
Rolling Stone described their song "Breaking the Habit" as "risky,
beautiful art".[283]\n'], ['On December 19, 2023, the WHO declared
that another distinctive variant, JN.1, had emerged as a "variant of
interest". Though the WHO expects an increase in cases globally,
particularly for countries entering winter, the current overall global
health risk (as of December 21, 2023) remains low.[117][118]\n'],
['The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of
the body. COVID 19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory
tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract
(windpipe and lungs).[119] The lungs are the organs most affected by
COVID 19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for
the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most
abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[120]
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to
connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.[121]\n'], ['In
2020, outbreaks occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability
to enforce adequate social distancing.[237][238] In the United States,
the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk
for poor outcomes from COVID 19 due to high rates of coexisting heart
and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality
healthcare.[237]\n'], ['Linkin Park also participated in numerous
charitable events, which included raising money to benefit victims of
Hurricane Charley in 2004 and later Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[10] The
band donated $75,000 to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation in
March 2004.[57] They also helped relief efforts for the 2004 Indian
Ocean tsunami victims by staging several charity concerts and setting
up an additional fund called Music for Relief.[58] The band
participated at Live 8, a series of charitable benefit concerts set up
to raise global awareness.[59] Alongside Jay-Z, the band performed on
Live 8\'s stage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a global
audience.[59] The band would later be reunited with Jay-Z at the
Grammy Award Ceremony 2006, during which they performed "Numb/Encore",
en route to winning a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.[60][61]
They were joined on stage by Paul McCartney who added verses from the
song "Yesterday".[62][63] They would later go on to play at the 2006
Summer Sonic music festival, which was hosted by Metallica in
Japan.[64]\n'], ['In November 2020, the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorisation for the
investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the
treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID 19.[510] Bamlanivimab is
authorised for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral
testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40
kilograms (88\xa0lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to
severe COVID 19 or hospitalisation.[510] This includes those who are
65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical
conditions.[510]\n']]
