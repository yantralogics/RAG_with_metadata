[['The transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden
fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory
tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. There are
three types of transmission:  droplet  and  contact , which are
associated with large droplets, and  airborne , which is associated
with small droplets.[85] If the droplets are above a certain critical
size, they settle faster than they evaporate, and therefore they
contaminate surfaces surrounding them.[85] Droplets that are below a
certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; due to that
fact, they form nuclei that remain airborne for a long period of time
over extensive distances.[85]\n'], ['In community and healthcare
settings, the use of face masks is intended as source control to limit
transmission of the virus and for personal protection to prevent
infection.[217] Properly worn masks both limit the respiratory
droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect
healthy individuals from infection.[218][219]\n'], ["The Renaissance
arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions
of the Aragonese Crown and the city of Valencia. Many early Spanish
Renaissance writers come from the Crown of Aragon, including Ausi s
March and Joanot Martorell. In the Crown of Castile, the early
Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting
with writers and poets such as the Marquis of Santillana, who
introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century.
Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del
Encina, Juan Bosc n Almog ver, and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close
resemblance to the Italian canon. Miguel de Cervantes's masterpiece
Don Quixote is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance
humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential
writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives, grammarian Antonio de
Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mex a.\n"], ['Postmodern
thinkers frequently describe knowledge claims and value systems as
contingent or socially-conditioned, describing them as products of
political, historical, or cultural discourses[29] and hierarchies.[4]
Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies
to self-referentiality, epistemological and moral relativism,
pluralism, and irreverence.[4] Postmodernism is often associated with
schools of thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism.[4]
Postmodernism relies on critical theory, which considers the effects
of ideology, society, and history on culture.[30] Postmodernism and
critical theory commonly criticize universalist ideas of objective
reality, morality, truth, human nature, reason, language, and social
progress.[4]\n'], ['Modelling research has been conducted with several
objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of
transmission,[482] diagnosis and prognosis of infection,[483]
estimation of the impact of interventions,[484][485] or allocation of
resources.[486] Modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental
models in epidemiology,[487] estimating the number of infected people
over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have
been developed and used during the COVID 19 pandemic including
computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID
19,[488] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant
exposure,[489] mobility-data based models to investigate
transmission,[490] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the
economic impact of the pandemic.[491]\n'], ['The risks of cognitive
deficit, dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures
persists at an increased level two years after infection.[331]\n'],
['A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe
COVID 19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction
where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are
released too quickly. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple
organ failure.[513] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan,
China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID
19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in
their system than patients who had milder responses. These high levels
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a
cytokine storm.[514]\n'], ['Renaissance art marks a cultural rebirth
at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of
the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of
highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267 1337) is
credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it
was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi
(1377 1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404
1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic
technique.[63]\n'], ['Preventive measures to reduce the chances of
infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask
in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others,
ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[190]
washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty
seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching
the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[191][192]\n'], ['Linkin
Park is among both the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the
world\'s best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million
records worldwide.[5] They have won two Grammy Awards, six American
Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards,
10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003,
MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era
and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park
No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was
voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on
VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as "The Biggest Rock Band in the
World Right Now" by Kerrang!.\n']]
