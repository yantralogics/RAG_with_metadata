[['Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing
inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and
the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T\xa0cells were
shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting
monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID 19.[153]
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[123]\n'],
['In literature the later part of the 16th century saw the flowering
of Elizabethan literature, with poetry heavily influenced by Italian
Renaissance literature but Elizabethan theatre a distinctive native
style. Writers include William Shakespeare (1564 1616), Christopher
Marlowe (1564 1593), Edmund Spenser (1552 599), Sir Thomas More (1478
1535), and Sir Philip Sidney (1554 1586). English Renaissance music
competed with that in Europe with composers such as Thomas Tallis
(1505 1585), John Taverner (1490 1545), and William Byrd (1540 1623).
Elizabethan architecture produced the large prodigy houses of
courtiers, and in the next century Inigo Jones (1573 1652), who
introduced Italianate architecture to England.[94]\n'], ['Meteora
earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV
awards for Best Rock Video for "Somewhere I Belong"[48][49] and the
Viewer\'s Choice Award for "Breaking the Habit".[50] Linkin Park also
received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards,
winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year ("Numb")
awards.[51] Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid
Theory, it was the third best selling album in the United States
during 2003.[10] The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring
around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and
later several European concerts.[10] At the same time, the band\'s
relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on
account of several trust and financial issues.[52] After months of
feuding, the band finally negotiated a deal in December 2005.[53]\n'],

office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover

the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to
Germany and the Low Countries, where the development of the printing
press (ca. 1450) and Renaissance artists such as Albrecht D rer (1471
1528) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas
of the country humanism became closely linked to the turmoil of the
Reformation, and the art and writing of the German Renaissance
frequently reflected this dispute.[99] However, the Gothic style and
medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of
the 16th century. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg (ruling 1493 1519)
was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the Holy Roman Empire.\n'],
['Linkin Park embarked on a large world tour titled "Minutes to
Midnight World Tour". The band promoted the album\'s release by

fourth Projekt Revolution tour before taking up an Arena tour around
the United Kingdom, visiting Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester,[82]
before finishing on a double night at the O2 arena in London.[83]
Bennington stated that Linkin Park plans to release a follow-up album
to Minutes to Midnight.[84] However, he stated the band will first
embark on a United States tour to gather inspiration for the
album.[84] Linkin Park embarked on another Projekt Revolution tour in
2008.[85] The United States Projekt Revolution tour featured Chris
Cornell, the Bravery, Ashes Divide, Street Drum Corps and many
others.[85] Mike Shinoda announced a live CD/DVD titled Road to
Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes, which is a live video recording
from the Projekt Revolution gig at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 29,
2008, which was officially released on November 24, 2008.[86]\n'],
['In the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its
birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of
Europe. The invention of the printing press by German printer Johannes
Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it
spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local
culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance
into regional and national movements.\n'], ["Renaissance humanists
such as Poggio Bracciolini sought out in Europe's monastic libraries
the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of antiquity,
while the fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of  migr
Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of
which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It was in their new focus
on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so
markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th
century, who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural
sciences, philosophy, and mathematics, rather than on such cultural
texts.[citation needed]\n"]]
