[['Linkin Park combines elements of metal, industrial, punk, pop,
electronic, hip hop.[250] More specifically, the band has been
categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal,
alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, and
industrial rock.[note 1] Despite being considered nu metal, the band
never considered themselves as such.[274]\n'], ['Lenzilumab, an anti-
GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T
cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option
due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T\xa0cells
in hospitalised patients with COVID 19.[522]\n'], ['On December 19,
2023, the WHO declared that another distinctive variant, JN.1, had
emerged as a "variant of interest". Though the WHO expects an increase
in cases globally, particularly for countries entering winter, the
current overall global health risk (as of December 21, 2023) remains
low.[117][118]\n'], ['In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin
Park played at Club Nokia during the "Music for Relief: Concert for
the Philippines" in Los Angeles, and raised donations for
victims.[248][249] The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February
15.[248][249] Other artists during the show included the Offspring,
Bad Religion, Heart, and the Filharmonic.[248][249]\n'], ['Reviews of
various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is
effective in protecting the individual against
COVID-19.[218][220][221] Various case-control and population-based
studies have also shown that increased levels of masking in a
community reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2,[220][221] though there is
a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials
(RCTs).[222][223] Masks vary in how well they work, with N95 and
surgical masks outperforming cloth masks,[224] but even cloth masks,
with their variability in fabric type and mask fit, provide wearers
with substantial protection from particles carrying
COVID-19.[225]\n'], ['Research on the antimalarial drugs
hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective
at best,[496][497] and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of
remdesivir.[498] By May 2020[update], France, Italy, and Belgium had
banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID 19
treatment.[499]\n'], ['A suitable environment had developed to
question classical scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the
New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview.
The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found
to not always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and
Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a
decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to
chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and
medicine).[73] The willingness to question previously held truths and
search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific
advancements.\n'], ['In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the
Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to India of the Delhi
Sultanate. He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he
had reached the East Indies.\n'], ['In all, the Renaissance can be
viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular
and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and
through novel approaches to thought. Political philosopher Hans Kohn
describes it as an age where "Men looked for new foundations"; some
like Erasmus and Thomas More envisioned new reformed spiritual
foundations, others. in the words of Machiavelli, una lunga sperienza
delle cose moderne ed una continua lezione delle antiche (a long
experience with modern life and a continuous learning from
antiquity).[27]\n'], ['The album\'s first single, "What I\'ve Done",
was released on April 2,[68] and premiered on MTV and Fuse within the
same week.[72] The single peaked at no. 7 on the Billboard Hot
100.[73] The song is also used in soundtrack for the 2007 action film,
Transformers.[74][75] Mike Shinoda was also featured on the Styles of
Beyond song "Second to None", which was also included in the film.[75]
Later in the year, the band won the "Favorite Alternative Artist" in
the American Music Awards.[76] The band also saw success with the rest
of the album\'s singles, "Bleed It Out", "Shadow of the Day", "Given
Up", and "Leave Out All the Rest", which were released throughout 2007
and early 2008. The band also collaborated with Busta Rhymes on his
single "We Made It", which was released on April 29.[77]\n']]
